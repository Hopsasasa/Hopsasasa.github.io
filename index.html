                My name is Kevin Gravesen, and I am a Danish student, studying at the IT
                University of Copenhagen as a 2nd year software developer. I enjoy solving
                unique problems and designing creative solutions to unique tasks. That is the
                reason I started creating my own programs at the age of 15. Besides developing
                video games and desktop software, I have ventured into other corners of
                software development, such as when I made electronic gadgets through the
                use of Arduinos and Raspberry Piâ€™s. Such devices include a popcorn vending
                machine, an NFC activated door lock, smart manager for solar panels etc.. One
                of my latest projects has been to create a sudoku-maker algorithm for an
                Android, as my understanding of runtime complexities became an interest of
                mine. Lastly, I have made a social media platform as a group project on ITU. My
                existing spark and knowledge of software has only grown with time, and I
                believe it can grow even further as a professional software developer.
